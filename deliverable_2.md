## Examples of stakeholders include users, clients, competitors, detractors, developers, etc.
# Functional Requirements (Features)

# Non-Functional Requirements
# Make a numbered list of non-functional requirements that are important for your software.

# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
# What will be your MVP? Which features are you going to validate? How?

# Use Cases
##    Use Case Diagram
*Include a UML use case diagram for your project*
##    Use case descriptions and interface sketch
# Present one complete use case description for each member of the group.
# Follow the template provided by OpenUP to describe the use cases (see also the example):
# https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~johnmc/courses/Publish/openup/guidances/templates/resources/uc_specification_tpl.dot 
# After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability. 

# User Stories
# Write two user stories for each member of the group. 
# They can be related to the same features described in the use cases or to different ones. Adopt the following format: "As a <ROLE>, I want <SOMETHING> so that <GOAL>." 
# Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will demand using the planning poker approach. 

# Issue Tracker
# Git hub or Tello
