# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
For our team project, we will be creating a simple browser-based gaming website for our MVP. It will be developed slowly, by first creating the website as a basis for our games, with this website following the first 5 functional requirements. The website will only contain 1 game, and the game and the website will be created in collaboration with all of us. Each of these requirements will be tested and validated by creating the working website first, and then having all of us, as well as some outside sources, attempt to make sure the functional requirements are satisfied by testing the website and the game. This will allow us to collect feedback on the quality of our MVP.

##    Use case descriptions and interface sketch
# Present one complete use case description for each member of the group.
# Follow the template provided by OpenUP to describe the use cases (see also the example):
# https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~johnmc/courses/Publish/openup/guidances/templates/resources/uc_specification_tpl.dot 
# After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability. 

# User Stories
# Write two user stories for each member of the group. 
# They can be related to the same features described in the use cases or to different ones. Adopt the following format: "As a <ROLE>, I want <SOMETHING> so that <GOAL>." 
# Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will demand using the planning poker approach. 

# Issue Tracker
# Git hub or Tello
