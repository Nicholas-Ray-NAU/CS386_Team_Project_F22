# Introduction:
    We have decided to create a web-hosted gaming site featuring 4-5 simple games. Some games we most likely will include are Pong, Chess, Checkers, and Tic-tac-toe. The website will have a queueing system that tracks when a user selects a game and pairs them with the next available user. Skill-based matchmaking may be implemented, as well as potentially having a leaderboard and even an AI to play with in the event of low user counts. The website will offer a wide variety of games that provides open access to anyone looking to play.
