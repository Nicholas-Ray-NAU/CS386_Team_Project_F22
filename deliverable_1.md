describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.

# Initial value proposition and customer segments: 
report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.

Grading criteria (5 points): The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality.
