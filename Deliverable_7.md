# Description
We aim to address the problem that there is a lack of convenient and inclusive ways to game with other gamers. The Impact of this is a disconnected group of gamers. For gamers who need an online platform to connect with others, GameyTime will be an online gaming platform that is an extremely convenient method for connecting with other gamers. Unlike other platforms that require you to download extra software or create an online account, our product will make it easier and faster for all gamers to game together. We will deliver a fast, easy-to-navigate, and efficient browser-based gaming website that will include a wide variety of games for free. The website is easily accessible by any type of person of any age and will allow multiple people to quickly connect and play together online. Our intended audience/consumer is casual gamers of any age who also have access to an internet connection and are looking to play a casual game with someone else online.

Users will connect to the website by inputting the link www.gameytime.me into a browser. Users will have the option to create a profile on the website which will store the user rankings, games ratings, and achievements, or create a temporary username to quickly play any game offered by our site. Users will select a single game lobby to join from a variety of possible games, which will include tic-tac-toe, checkers, mancala, and other tabletop games. Once a user selects a game lobby, they will be placed into a queue. Users will wait in a game specific queue until they can be paired with the appropriate number of players needed. Users have the option to send a message through the use of an in-game chat, by typing any string into the chat box. In-game chat will be moderated to ensure a clean dialog between users. Users with a profile will be able to look at their game statistics and acquired achievements. The landing page will display a leaderboard containing rankings from other users with profiles. The user interface will be simple and clean.

# Verification (tests)
## Unit test

A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, show an example of a unit test that uses mock objects to isolate the class from the rest of the system. 

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.):
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution. 

Grading criteria (5 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate use of Mock objects, and a print screen showing successful test execution.

## Acceptance test
An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.):
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are located.
An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature.
A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution. 

Grading criteria (7 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate example of an acceptance test, print screen/video showing successful tests execution.

# Validation (user evaluation)
Validation aims to ensure that you developed the right product. At the beginning of the semester, you talked to the clients/potential users to understand their needs. Now it is time to check if you are on the right track by conducting some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this deliverable the following information:

Script: The script should have the tasks that you gave to the user, what data you collected, and the questions you asked. In particular, do not forget to add questions about the users’ general impressions. You can ask open questions (e.g., How would you describe the homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the competitor X?) or closed questions (On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? On the same scale, how likely would you use the system in its current state?). Take a look at the inception and requirements deliverables to help create the script. Design a script to check if you are achieving your initial goals and if the features are implemented in a satisfactory way.
