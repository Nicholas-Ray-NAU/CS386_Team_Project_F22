# Introduction
We aim to deliver a fast, easy-to-navigate, and efficient browser-based gaming website that will offer a wide variety of games for free. The website is easily accessible for any type of person of any age and will allow multiple people to quickly connect and play together online. Our webpage will have a database that will store user account data. User accounts will have achievements, and game statistics. Games hosted on the website are open to being reviewed by the players to ensure the quality of games. Games will also have a queueing lobby so that everyone has a fair chance to play a game. In a game, users will have access to an in-game chat and game leaderboard.

# Look & feel
We intended to create a user interface which remained as accessible as possible while also creating a cohesive aesthetic style. Simplicity and ease of use were our primary objectives, as this would in turn allow a wider variety of players to use our website. Furthermore, we tried to maintain a consistent style throughout the website, which will give our website a signature aesthetic no matter which game the user decides to play.


# Lessons learned
In the process of producing this MVP, our team was able to experience the overall work from basic website configuration to server work that allows two users to play games at the same time through the server. Each team member has different advantages, so collaboration could be carried out effectively.
In the next release, various functions will be incorporated, so we will pay more attention to co-working. In addition, branch management should be paid attention because there are cases where the same code is jointly modified.
